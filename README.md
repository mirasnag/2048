List the key features of your 2048 game implementation here.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 2048 game, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/mirasnag/2048.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd 2048
3. Open the `2048.html` file in your web browser to start playing the game.

## Usage

Once you've opened the game, you can start playing right away. Here are the basic instructions for playing the 2048 game:

1. The game board consists of a grid of cells, and you start with two tiles, typically with a value of 2 or 4.

2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.

3. Tiles with the same value will merge into one tile when they collide. The goal is to reach the tile with a value of 2048.

4. The game continues until you can't make any more moves.

5. Your score is based on the values of the tiles you've merged during the game.

6. Have fun and challenge yourself to achieve the highest score and reach 2048!
